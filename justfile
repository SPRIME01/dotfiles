# Justfile for dotfiles project

# This Justfile defines common tasks for setting up, testing and maintaining
# the dotfiles project.  Just is a cross‑platform command runner similar to
# Make but with a simpler syntax.  See <https://github.com/casey/just> for
# installation instructions on your platform.

# Display a list of available tasks when no target is specified.
default:
    @just --list

# Run all automated tests.  This will execute shell tests and PowerShell
# tests (if pwsh is available) to verify that environment loaders and other
# components behave correctly.
test:
    @bash scripts/run-tests.sh

# Launch the interactive setup wizard for Unix shells.  This script
# guides you through configuring shells, installing optional components
# like VS Code settings, and enabling MCP/SSH integration.
setup:
    @bash scripts/setup-wizard.sh

# Launch the interactive setup wizard for Windows using PowerShell.  Use this
# target if you’re on Windows and have PowerShell 7 installed.  The wizard
# will call the PowerShell bootstrap script and other installers.
