# OpenVINO GenAI Reference Artifacts

Artifacts emitted by `scripts/setup-openvino-genai.sh` (invoked via `just openvino-setup`) and related helpers live here so they can be versioned alongside the dotfiles. Generate the requirements lock once `/opt/openvino-genai/venv` is fully populated, then review and commit the resulting file.
