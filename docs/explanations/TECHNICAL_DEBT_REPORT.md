# Technical Debt Report

This report summarizes the findings of a technical debt analysis of the dotfiles project.

## Summary

The dotfiles project is a well-structured and feature-rich collection of dotfiles for unifying shell configurations across PowerShell, Zsh, and Bash. However, there are several areas where the project could be improved to reduce technical debt and improve maintainability.

## Issues

### 1. Inconsistent Coding Styles

There are some inconsistencies in the coding style of the shell scripts. For example, some scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` while others use `#!/bin/bash`. This can make the code harder to read and maintain.

**Recommendation:** Adopt a consistent coding style for all shell scripts and enforce it using a linter like `shellcheck`.

### 2. Duplicate Code

The `DOTFILES` variable is defined multiple times in `bootstrap.sh`. This makes the code harder to maintain and increases the risk of errors.

**Recommendation:** Define the `DOTFILES` variable only once and reuse it throughout the script.

### 3. Hardcoded Paths

The scripts use `~` for the home directory instead of `$HOME`. While this is generally fine, using `$HOME` is more explicit and sometimes safer.

**Recommendation:** Use `$HOME` instead of `~` for the home directory.

### 4. Lack of Error Handling

The scripts could benefit from more specific error handling and user feedback. For example, the `bootstrap.sh` script could check if the symlinks were created successfully and provide a more informative error message if they were not.

**Recommendation:** Add more specific error handling and user feedback to the scripts.

### 5. Network Dependency

The scripts' dependency on a network connection could be problematic in offline environments. The `NO_NETWORK` flag is a good workaround, but it's not consistently used.

**Recommendation:** Make the scripts more robust to network failures and use the `NO_NETWORK` flag consistently.

### 6. Clarity of Output

The scripts could provide more detailed information about what they're doing. For example, the `bootstrap.sh` script could list the symlinks it's creating.

**Recommendation:** Improve the clarity of the scripts' output.

### 7. Incomplete `doctor.sh` script

The `doctor.sh` script is missing the `check_optional` function and could be more comprehensive. For example, it could check for the existence of symlinks, the versions of installed tools, and the status of the network connection.

**Recommendation:** Complete the `doctor.sh` script and make it more comprehensive.

### 8. Basic CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline could be improved by caching dependencies, running jobs in parallel, adding more tests, and adding a deployment step.

**Recommendation:** Improve the CI/CD pipeline to make it more efficient and effective.

### 9. No Clear Versioning

There is no clear versioning strategy for the dotfiles. This makes it difficult to track changes and roll back to previous versions.

**Recommendation:** Adopt a versioning strategy for the dotfiles, such as semantic versioning.

### 10. Lack of Documentation for Some Scripts

Some of the scripts are not well-documented. This makes it difficult to understand what they do and how to use them.

**Recommendation:** Add documentation to all scripts, explaining what they do and how to use them.
