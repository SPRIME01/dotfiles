## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Just** command runner: [Install Just](https://github.com/casey/just#installation)
- **Git** for repository management
- **Zsh** or **Bash** shell (Zsh recommended)
- **PowerShell 7** (Windows users)

### 30-Second Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SPRIME01/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles

# Run interactive setup
just setup
```

That's it! The setup wizard will guide you through the rest.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Basic Setup (All Platforms)

The interactive setup wizard is the recommended way to install:

```bash
just setup
```

This command launches `scripts/setup-wizard-improved.sh` which provides:
- **Idempotent state management**: Tracks installed components to avoid redundant operations
- **Smart prompting**: Only asks about components not already installed
- **Failure recovery**: Identifies and allows retry of failed installations
- **Force reinstall option**: Option to reinstall all components
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Detailed status tracking and reporting

The improved wizard will:
- Detect your platform and shell
- Show current installation status (if any previous setup exists)
- Configure environment variables
- Set up Oh My Zsh (if desired)
- Install VS Code settings
- Configure MCP integration
- Set up SSH agent (where supported)
- Track all installation states for future runs

### 2. Windows-Specific Setup

For Windows users with PowerShell 7:

```bash
just setup-windows
```

This launches the PowerShell version of the setup wizard (`scripts/setup-wizard.ps1`) with Windows-specific optimizations.

### 3. Complete Windows Integration

For full Windows/WSL2 integration:

```bash
just setup-windows-integration
```

This comprehensive command:
- Sets up the projects directory with Windows access
- Configures PowerShell 7 profile
- Creates WSL-Windows symlinks
- Fixes shell configuration issues

### 4. Projects Directory Setup (Improved & Idempotent)

Create a unified projects directory with Windows access (WSL2):

```bash
just setup-projects
```

The **improved idempotent version** provides:

**Safe Operations**:
- âœ… Checks existing state before making changes
- âœ… Never overwrites working configurations
- âœ… Provides clear status of all operations
- âœ… Safe to run multiple times

**Smart Windows Integration**:
- Detects existing symlinks and preserves them
- Only creates batch file if symlink creation fails
- Handles permission requirements gracefully
- Provides manual instructions when needed

**What it creates**:
- `~/projects` directory in WSL2 (always safe)
- Windows symlink at `C:\Users\{username}\projects` (if possible)
- Batch file fallback: `projects.bat` (if symlink requires admin)
- PowerShell function integration (if available)

**Status Reporting**:
```bash
# Example output showing current state
âœ… Projects directory ensured at ~/projects
âœ… Windows symlink already exists and is working
ðŸŽ‰ Projects setup complete!
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Existing directories (won't overwrite)
- Failed symlink creation (creates batch fallback)
- Missing permissions (provides manual instructions)
- Conflicting files (reports and suggests resolution)

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

The system supports multiple environment files:

- **Global**: `~/.env` (optional)
- **MCP**: `~/dotfiles/mcp/.env` (created during setup)
- **Custom**: Any `.env` file you specify

### Modular Architecture

The shell configuration uses a modular system:

```
shell/
â”œâ”€â”€ common/              # Cross-shell configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ platform-specific/  # OS-specific settings
â”œâ”€â”€ bash/               # Bash-specific config
â””â”€â”€ zsh/                # Zsh-specific config
```

### Security Features

- **File Permission Validation**: Ensures `.env` files have secure permissions (600)
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Checks for required variables
- **Input Sanitization**: Validates environment variable content
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Prevents committing sensitive data

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
export DOTFILES_DEBUG=true
```

### State Management & Idempotency

The improved setup wizard includes sophisticated state management to make all operations idempotent and reliable:

#### State File

The system maintains a state file at `~/dotfiles/.dotfiles-state` that tracks:
- **Installed components**: Successfully completed installations
- **Failed components**: Components that failed with error details
- **Skipped components**: Components explicitly skipped by user or system

#### Smart Setup Behavior

**First Run**:
- Prompts for all available components
- Creates state file to track selections and results

**Subsequent Runs**:
- Shows current installation status
- Only prompts for uninstalled or failed components
- Offers to retry failed components only
- Provides force reinstall option for all components

#### State Management Commands

```bash
# View current installation status
just setup  # Will show status if previous runs exist

# Force reinstall all components
just setup  # Choose "force reinstall" when prompted

# Retry only failed components
just setup  # Choose "retry failed only" when prompted
```

#### State File Format

```bash
# Example .dotfiles-state file
bash_config=installed
zsh_config=installed
pwsh_config=skipped # PowerShell not available
vscode_settings=failed # VS Code installer failed
git_hook=installed
projects_setup=installed
setup_completed=2025-08-05T10:30:00Z
```

#### Component States

- **`installed`**: Component successfully installed and configured
- **`failed`**: Installation failed with recorded error reason
- **`skipped`**: User chose not to install or system prerequisite missing

#### Benefits

âœ… **Safe to re-run**: Never duplicates work or breaks existing config
âœ… **Failure recovery**: Easily retry only what failed
âœ… **Selective updates**: Install new components without affecting existing ones
âœ… **Transparency**: Always shows what's installed and what's not
âœ… **Time saving**: Skips already-completed work automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Powerlevel10k Instant Prompt Warnings

**Issue**: Console output interfering with instant prompt
**Solution**: Debug mode is now conditional - warnings should be resolved

#### 2. Oh My Zsh Not Loading

**Issue**: Shell starts but Oh My Zsh features missing
**Solution**:
```bash
just diagnose-shell
# If issues found:
just fix-env-loading
```

#### 3. SSH Agent Not Working

**Issue**: SSH keys not loading automatically
**Solution**:
```bash
# For Windows/WSL2:
scoop install npiperelay
just enable-ssh-agent
```

#### 4. PowerShell Profile Errors

**Issue**: PowerShell shows errors on startup
**Solution**:
```bash
just fix-pwsh7
just clean-old-powershell-profiles
```

#### 5. Environment Variables Not Loading

**Issue**: Custom environment variables not available
**Solution**:
```bash
just fix-env-loading
# Check your .env file permissions:
chmod 600 ~/dotfiles/mcp/.env
```

#### 6. State Management Issues

**Issue**: State file shows incorrect status
**Solution**:
```bash
# Reset specific component state
rm ~/dotfiles/.dotfiles-state  # Remove entire state file
just setup  # Re-run setup wizard

# Or manually edit state file
nano ~/dotfiles/.dotfiles-state
```

**Issue**: Want to reinstall specific component
**Solution**:
```bash
# Edit state file to remove component entry
sed -i '/^component_name=/d' ~/dotfiles/.dotfiles-state
just setup  # Will prompt for that component again
```

**Issue**: Setup wizard shows "already installed" but component not working
**Solution**:
```bash
# Force reinstall all components
just setup
# Choose "force reinstall all components" when prompted
```

### Diagnostic Commands

Run comprehensive diagnostics:

```bash
# Full system check
just diagnose-shell

# Specific issue checks
just fix-env-loading
just fix-alias-conflicts

# State management diagnostics
just setup  # Shows current installation status
cat ~/dotfiles/.dotfiles-state  # View raw state file
```

### State Management Diagnostics

**Check Installation Status**:
```bash
# Quick status check
just setup
# Will immediately show installation status if any setup has been done

# View state file directly
cat ~/dotfiles/.dotfiles-state
```

**Common State Patterns**:
```bash
# All components successful
bash_config=installed
zsh_config=installed
vscode_settings=installed

# Mixed success/failure (retry available)
zsh_config=installed
pwsh_config=failed # PowerShell bootstrap script failed
vscode_settings=skipped # user choice

# Fresh installation
# (file doesn't exist or is empty)
```

### Manual Recovery

If automatic fixes don't work:

1. **Backup Current Config**:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.backup
   cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.backup
   ```

2. **Reset to Basic Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Remove modular loading temporarily
   # Edit .zshrc to comment out dotfiles loading
   ```

3. **Gradual Re-enablement**:
   ```bash
   # Re-run setup with minimal profile
   just setup
   # Choose "minimal" when prompted
   ```

## Development & Testing

### Running Tests

Execute the full test suite:

```bash
just test
```

This runs:
- Shell configuration tests
- Environment loading tests
- PowerShell tests (if available)
- Integration tests

### Contributing
