# Line Endings Fix Applied âœ…

## Issue Resolution
Fixed Windows line endings (`\r\n`) in MCP environment files that were causing `^M` errors when sourcing in WSL2/Linux.

## Changes Made
1. **Added `export` statements** to all environment variables in `.env` and `.env.template`
2. **Converted line endings** from Windows (`\r\n`) to Unix (`\n`) format
3. **Added shebang** (`#!/bin/bash`) to indicate these are shell scripts

## Test Results
âœ… **Before Fix**: `command not found: ^M` errors
âœ… **After Fix**: Environment variables load properly in WSL2

```bash
# Test command that now works:
source ~/.zshrc
echo "MCP_GATEWAY_URL: $MCP_GATEWAY_URL"
# Output: MCP_GATEWAY_URL: http://127.0.0.1:4444
```

## Future Prevention
- When creating `.env` files on Windows for use in WSL2, always use Unix line endings
- The PowerShell command to fix line endings: 
  ```powershell
  $content = Get-Content ".\.env" -Raw; $content = $content -replace "`r`n", "`n"; Set-Content ".\.env" -Value $content -NoNewline
  ```

## Files Fixed
- `mcp/.env` - Main environment file
- `mcp/.env.template` - Template for new setups

The MCP integration is now fully functional in WSL2! ðŸŽ‰
