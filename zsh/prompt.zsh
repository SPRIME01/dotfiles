# Prompt configuration for zsh
#
# This file sets the theme for Oh My Zsh.  The default theme uses
# powerlevel10k, providing consistency with Oh‑My‑Posh in PowerShell.  If
# powerlevel10k is not installed, the script falls back to the default theme.

export ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"

# Powerlevel10k configuration is loaded at the end of .zshrc
